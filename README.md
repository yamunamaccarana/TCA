TCA
===



This is the repository for the [Task Component Architecture](https://github.com/yamunamaccarana/TCA/wiki).



The work presented is motivated by the aim of simplifying the integration of robotic and information systems technology.


For this purpose, we created the Task Component Architecture, a framework for the implementation of SCA components that execute autonomously their service and that can be seamlessly integrated with robotic software control systems.
